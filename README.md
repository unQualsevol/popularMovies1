# Movie advisor
This is an android app result of the second project of Udacity's 'Associate Android Developer Fast Track Program'.

The app allows users to discover the most popular movies playing. This app makes calls to The Movie DB (https://www.themoviedb.org/). In order to be able to do calls an API Key is required.

As expected the API Key that I'm using it's not committed at any place in the code. Anyone who want to use this needs to replace the INSERT_YOUR_API_KEY at 'app/build.gradle' with his own API key.

Thank you for your visit.
